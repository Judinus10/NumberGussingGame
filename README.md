# Number Guessing Game ðŸŽ²

## Overview
This repository contains a simple Python script for a Number Guessing Game. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user is prompted to guess the number. The game provides feedback to help the user guess the number correctly.

## How It Works
1. The script uses Python's `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. The user is asked to guess the number through the command line.
3. After each guess, the script will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high.
4. The loop continues until the user guesses the correct number.
5. Once the correct number is guessed, the game ends with a congratulatory message.

## How to Run the Game
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-guessing-game.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd number-guessing-game
   ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   ```bash
   python3 number_guessing_game.py
   ```

## Example Output
```
Guess a number between 1 to 100: 50
Your guess is too low!
Guess again: 75
Your guess is too high!
Guess again: 60
Congrats!!! 
You guessed it right!
```

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
```

### Key Adjustments:
1. **Clone Command Formatting**: I closed the code block that starts with `git clone ...` to ensure proper formatting in the `README.md`.
2. **Example Output Section**: The example output should be in its own section to make it clear that it's sample output from running the script.

Other than these small tweaks, everything else is correct and ready for your `README.md`!
